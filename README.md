## 📖 Overview

**Responsive Exam Clock** is a single-file web utility built to display the current time clearly and elegantly on any screen. 

Unlike standard system clocks, this tool is optimized for **projection** and **distance reading**. It features a Swiss-style analog face paired with a tabular-numeral digital display, ensuring readability whether displayed on a 100-inch projector screen or a 13-inch laptop.

## ✨ Features

* **🇨🇭 Swiss Design**: A clean, distraction-free interface inspired by classic Swiss railway clocks.
* **🌗 Dark & Light Themes**: One-click toggle to switch between themes, perfect for dim exam rooms or bright classrooms.
* **📱 True Responsiveness**: The canvas redraws itself on window resize, ensuring crisp graphics on Retina/4K displays and correct proportions on any device.
* **⚡ Double-Click Fullscreen**: simple gesture control to maximize the display and hide browser UI.
* **🌐 Bilingual Interface**: Built-in support for English and Chinese (switchable via UI).
* **🚀 Zero Dependencies**: Built with pure Vanilla JS, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3. No frameworks, no installation required.
